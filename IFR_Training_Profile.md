# T IFR Training Flight Profile – Cockpit Checklist Edition
*(For use in any single-engine training aircraft under IFR)*  
*(Speeds, power, and configurations: set as appropriate for aircraft type)*

---

## 1️⃣ Pre-Flight & Setup

**Objective:** Ensure all navigation, radios, and flight instruments are correctly configured for IFR training.

- Review **weather, NOTAMs, and flight plan** (IFR clearance route)
- Verify **altimeter setting, pitot heat, and vacuum/gyro ops**
- Set **NAV/COM 1 & 2** → primary and backup frequencies
- Load **GPS or VOR route** (as briefed)
- Set **OBS/course selectors** for initial outbound radial
- Brief **departure procedure** and expected altitude
- Verify **heading bug**, CDI source, and timer ready
- Review **missed approach** plan and re-entry sequence

---

## 2️⃣ Departure & Climb

**Objective:** Maintain instrument reference and accurate climb performance.

- **Rotate** (Vr ___ KIAS), maintain **Vy/VyI (___ KIAS)** until assigned altitude  
- **Positive rate – gear up (if retractable)**
- Transition smoothly to **instrument scan**
- Track assigned **heading / course** using **VOR or GPS**
- Maintain climb power and trim for steady pitch attitude
- Level off within **±100 ft**, **±10°**, **±10 kts**

---

## 3️⃣ Enroute / Intercept Segment

**Objective:** Intercept and track VOR/GPS course accurately.

- Identify **VOR station** (Morse ID check)
- Tune & set inbound or outbound radial
- Intercept course with **standard rate turns**
- Maintain **altitude ±100 ft**, **heading ±10°**
- Cross-check **DME/GPS distance** and timing
- Note estimated time to fix; prepare for hold or next leg

---

## 4️⃣ Holding Pattern

**Objective:** Demonstrate proper entry and timing for standard holding procedures.

- Review **hold clearance** and inbound course
- Determine **entry type** (direct / parallel / teardrop)
- Set **timer** upon crossing fix
- Maintain:
  - **Airspeed:** (set as appropriate)
  - **Bank:** standard rate or ≤20°
  - **Altitude:** ±100 ft
- **Timing:** outbound leg 1 minute (adjust for wind)
- Cross-check instruments and make position reports if required
- Prepare for outbound intercept and inbound re-entry

---

## 5️⃣ Approach Sequence

**Objective:** Fly published approach accurately using instruments only.

- Load and brief **approach plate**
- Verify **NAV source (GPS/VLOC)** and frequencies
- Set **course** and **minimums (MDA/DA)**
- Complete **Before Approach Checklist**
- Begin **descent** at appropriate fix or altitude
- Maintain:
  - **Localizer / VOR tracking ±½ scale**
  - **Glideslope / descent rate stabilized**
  - **Airspeed:** (set as appropriate)
- Make **callouts:** “100 above,” “minimums,” “missed”
- If runway not in sight at DA/MDA → **execute missed approach**

---

## 6️⃣ Missed Approach / Re-Entry

**Objective:** Safely transition from approach to climb and navigation back to hold or next segment.

- **Power:** set climb power  
- **Pitch:** 7–10° up (or as required)
- **Positive rate – gear up (if applicable)**
- **Flaps:** retract per aircraft procedure
- **Nav:** follow published missed-approach course
- **Alt:** climb to assigned altitude
- Re-establish **holding pattern** or proceed as briefed

---

## 7️⃣ Shutdown & Debrief Notes

**Objective:** Review performance and ensure aircraft is properly secured.

- Taxi clear of runway, complete **After Landing Checklist**
- Record any **equipment discrepancies**
- Review:
  - Instrument scan discipline
  - Course tracking accuracy
  - Radio/nav management
  - Missed approach flow
- Instructor feedback and next training focus

---

### 🧭 Notes

- This checklist supports the **standard IFR “T” profile** used in advanced instrument training.
- Suitable for **Cessna, Piper, Diamond, or similar single-engine trainers**.
- Customize speeds, climb rates, and power settings per POH.
