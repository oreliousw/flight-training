# ✈️ Commercial Pilot ASEL Checkride Flight Profile
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172 (typical 180 HP)  
**Reference:** FAA-S-ACS-7B (Commercial Pilot Airplane – Single-Engine Land)  
**Purpose:** Examiner flight sequence and evaluation reference.

---

## 1️⃣ Preflight / Ground Evaluation
**Objective:** Assess systems knowledge, decision making, and preparation.

**Tasks**
- Complete preflight inspection (fuel, oil, control continuity, prop, static system).  
- Confirm **weight & balance** within limits (full fuel + 2 occupants typical).  
- Review **performance**: TO/LDG distances, density altitude, cruise.  
- Discuss **systems**: propeller, fuel, electrical, pitot-static, vacuum, avionics.  
- Oral review: airspace, commercial privileges, risk management.

---

## 2️⃣ Start, Taxi, Run-Up
- Use checklist discipline, maintain wind corrections.  
- Brake check, verify instruments.  
- **Run-up:** 1700 RPM, mag drop ≤ 150 RPM (diff ≤ 50 RPM).  
- Mixture, ammeter, vacuum, annunciators check.  
- Takeoff briefing: runway, rotation 55 KIAS, climb Vy 74 KIAS.

---

## 3️⃣ Takeoff & Departure
| Type | Config | Target | Notes |
|------|---------|---------|-------|
| Normal | Flaps 0° | Vr 55 KIAS → Vy 74 KIAS | Smooth rotation |
| Short-field | Flaps 10° | Vr 51 KIAS → 56 KIAS climb | Clear 50′ obstacle |
| Soft-field | Flaps 10° | Stay in GE | Continuous back-pressure |

Climb to maneuver area (≈ 3–4 K AGL).

---

## 4️⃣ Maneuvers Sequence
### A. Steep Turns  
50° bank, ±100 ft alt, ±10 kts, ±5° heading.

### B. Chandelles  
Entry ≈ 100 KIAS, max performance, 180° turn, no altitude loss at completion.

### C. Lazy Eights  
Entry ≈ 105 KIAS, ±100 ft alt, ±10 kts, ±10° heading rollout.

### D. Eights on Pylons  
Pivotal alt ≈ 900 + (GS² / 15), ≈ 95 KIAS.  
Maintain line to each pylon using bank control.

### E. Power-Off 180° Accuracy Landing  
Abeam TD pt → Power idle → Flaps as needed.  
Touchdown within +200/-0 ft of point (no power add).

### F. Steep Spiral  
Power idle, ≈ 80 KIAS, ≤ 60° bank, clear area each 360°.

### G. Emergency Approach & Landing  
Airspeed 65 KIAS, troubleshoot simulated failure, maintain field alignment.

### H. Short/Soft Field Landings  
Short: 61 KIAS → TD +100/-0 ft.  
Soft: nose-high attitude, power through touchdown.

### I. Go-Around  
Full power, carb heat off, Vy 74 KIAS, flaps up gradually.

## 5️⃣ Navigation & Diversion
- Simulate GPS loss → pilotage + dead-reckoning.  
- Calculate diversion heading/ETA.  
- “4 C’s”: Confess, Climb, Communicate, Comply.

---

## 6️⃣ Slow Flight & Stalls
| Task | Config | Target | Notes |
|------|---------|---------|-------|
| Slow Flight | Flaps 30° | Maintain alt ±50 ft | |
| Power-Off Stall | Approach config | Recover @ buffet → Vy 74 KIAS | |
| Power-On Stall | TO config (0–10°) | Recover @ buffet → Vy 74 KIAS | |

---

## 7️⃣ Ground Reference (as required)
Rectangular course, S-turns, turns around a point. ±100 ft altitude.

---

## 8️⃣ Return & Landing
Normal or short-field to full stop.  
Use stabilized approach and centerline control (±½ width).

---

## 9️⃣ Post-Flight / Debrief
- Shutdown checklist.  
- Ask self-evaluation.  
- Review ACS tolerances and ADM observations.

---

## 10️⃣ Suggested Flight Flow (≈ 1.3–1.5 hr)
| Phase | Time | Focus |
|--------|------|-------|
| Taxi/Run-up | 0.1 hr | discipline |
| Takeoffs | 0.2 hr | 3 types |
| Maneuvers | 0.5 hr | sequence |
| Emerg/Accuracy | 0.3 hr | |
| Return/Debrief | 0.2 hr | wrap-up |

---

## Notes for Examiner
- Use scenario prompts (e.g., ferry flight, passenger flight).  
- Observe workload mgmt and risk decisions, not just precision.  
- Debrief using ACS standards; emphasize judgment and CRM.  
- *Yukkuri daijoubu (ゆっくり大丈夫)* = “take it easy, it’s okay” — good tone-setter.
