# Commercial Pilot Oral Prep Scenario — C172RG (Single-Engine Complex)

**Quick use**: Hand this to the student at the start. Use the Examiner Notes as your guide.  
*Goal*: Assess commercial-level knowledge, ADM, and systems proficiency per the ACS.

---

## 1) Scenario Overview (Give to Student)
You are PIC of a daytime VFR **business flight** in a **Cessna 172RG** from **KSBA (Santa Barbara)** to **KRNO (Reno/Tahoe)** with a planned fuel stop at **KSAC (Sacramento Executive)**. You’re carrying **two passengers** (a small media crew) and **camera gear** (bulky, moderate weight). Weather is **VFR en route**, with **mountain wave potential** and **gusty winds** north of the Central Valley. A trough is forecast to arrive this afternoon with **lowering ceilings north of Sacramento**.

**Mission constraints**
- Passengers are on a mild schedule (prefer on-time arrival but safety first).
- Client asks if you can “keep it VFR” to avoid delays.
- The aircraft is just out of 100‑hour inspection; a **minor gear microswitch was adjusted**.

**Your plan**
- VFR flight plan; conservative fuel stop at KSAC.
- Cruise altitude: initially 7,500–9,500 MSL (terrain + winds).

You’ll brief: performance, W&B, fuel, weather, airspace/terrain, systems risk, and alternates.

## 5) Student Prompts (Primary Oral Questions)
### A) Preflight / W&B / Performance
1. Compute **zero‑fuel weight**, **ramp weight**, **T/O weight**; verify **CG within limits** for both legs (gear up/down CG if published).  
2. TKOF distance KSBA and KSAC: show **POH table method** and **safety margins** for gusts/DA.  
3. **Climb gradient** and **cruise altitude** selections to safely cross the Sierras; discuss **escape routes** and **drift‑down**.  
4. Fuel plan: **T/O fuel**, **burn to KSAC**, **reserves** (commercial standard fuel policy), Taxi/contingency. Re‑compute for leg 2.

### B) Regulations (Commercial Privileges / 91 vs 135)
5. Explain **61.133** privileges/limitations. What *isn’t* allowed without 135?  
6. Is this flight **Part 91** or **Part 135**? Discuss **holding out**, **common carriage**, **compensation**.  
7. Logging **PIC**, carrying **company gear**, and **dry lease** vs **wet lease** pitfalls.

### C) Weather / ADM
8. Interpret a KSAC **METAR/TAF** that shows SCT/BKN layers lowering to 3,000–4,000 ft late afternoon, gusty SW winds. What are your **go/no‑go triggers**?  
9. Discuss **AIRMET Tango** (turbulence), potential **mountain wave**; how do winds aloft affect **route/altitude/fuel**?  
10. If ceilings drop below your personal minimums before KSAC, what’s your **diversion plan**? Identify at least **two realistic alternates**.

### D) Systems / Abnormals (C172RG)
11. **Gear motor runs continuously** after extension: likely causes and **QRH/POH actions**; **manual extension** steps.  
12. **Alternator failure** enroute: electrical load management, **battery endurance estimate**, daytime vs night considerations.  
13. **Constant‑speed prop** basics: governor, oil pressure role, **overspeed/underspeed** response, **prop control failure** indications.

### E) Airspace / Navigation / Terrain
14. Describe route valley→Sierra; **oxygen** at altitudes >12,500’ MSL (91.211).  
15. Identify any **SUA/TFRs** you’d check; **VFR flight following** use, and **lost‑comms** while VFR with FF.  
16. **Emergency landing site selection** over rugged terrain (best glide, wind, ELT/406, PLB/phone).

## 6) What‑If Variations (Use as Curveballs)
- KSAC crosswind component exceeds your **demonstrated** value — what now?  
- KRNO reports **LLWS** on final. Plans?  
- Fuel truck delay at KSAC; **weight trade‑offs** and impact on alternates.  
- **Gear fails to retract** after KSAC: climb/drag performance → terrain clearance?  
- Client adds a **third Pelican case (25 lb)** at KSAC; redo W&B/CG and brief limits.

---

## 7) Examiner Notes / Expected Elements (Condensed “Answer Key”)
- **Performance**: Uses correct POH tables, adjusts for DA/gusts/surface; articulates margins (15–25%).  
- **W&B**: Computes within limits, considers **baggage moment arm**, confirms no **aft CG** exceedance with fuel burn.  
- **Fuel**: Plans taxi/contingency; reserves: ≥45 min day VFR (company policy may exceed).  
- **91 vs 135**: Correctly defines **common carriage** & **holding out**; recognizes this scenario is typically **Part 91** unless engaging in holding out/compensation beyond allowable privileges.  
- **Weather**: Identifies **wave/turbulence** markers (PIREPs, AIRMETs), valley mechanical turbulence; sets rational personal mins.  
- **Systems**: Gear abnormal checklist memory items, **manual extension** procedure; **alternator‑out load shed** with time estimate.  
- **Maneuvers**: Knows **pivotal altitude = (groundspeed²)/11.3** (knots) ≈ (mph²)/15; power‑off 180 key points; steep spiral energy.  
- **Human factors**: Mitigates external pressure; verbalizes 5P/PAVE; declares divert/land‑and‑wait if needed.

- Bring your POH/AFM, W&B sheet, performance charts, EFB with **terrain profile** and **winds aloft**.  
- Expect to justify decisions like a **commercial PIC**: safety margin first, schedule last.

*Good luck — fly the plan, brief the risks, and communicate like PIC.*
