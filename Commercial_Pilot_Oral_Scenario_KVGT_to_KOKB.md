# Commercial Pilot Oral Prep Scenario — C172RG (Single-Engine Complex)

**Use:** For oral prep or mock checkride.  
**Goal:** Evaluate commercial-level judgment, ADM, and system proficiency.  

---

## 1️⃣ Scenario Overview (Give to Student)
You are PIC of a **daytime VFR business flight** in a **Cessna 172RG** from **North Las Vegas (KVGT)** to **Oceanside Municipal (KOKB)** with a **fuel stop at Palm Springs (KPSP)**.  
Your two passengers are **a real-estate media team** with photo equipment. Weather is **VFR departing Las Vegas**, but **coastal marine layer** and **gusty sea-breeze winds** are expected near Oceanside by early afternoon.  

**Mission constraints**
- Client prefers arrival by 1500 local for a coastal shoot.  
- They ask whether you can “stay VFR under the layer.”  
- The aircraft’s landing-gear squat switch was recently replaced after maintenance.

**Your plan**
- File VFR flight plan.  
- Cruise: 6,500 MSL → KPSP; 8,500 MSL → KOKB (terrain/MEA + winds).  

---

## 2️⃣ Examiner Objectives (ACS Focus)
- **Preflight & Performance:** W&B, takeoff/landing distance at DA > 3,000 ft; terrain climb planning.  
- **Regulations:** 61.133 commercial privileges; 91 vs 135 discussion.  
- **Weather & ADM:** Interprets marine-layer TAFs, mountain-wave & thermal turbulence.  
- **Systems:** Gear & prop operation, alternator management.  
- **Airspace:** Bravo (LAS), restricted areas, MOAs, Class C/B transitions, coastal SFRA.  
- **Maneuvers:** Steep spiral, power-off 180, eights-on-pylons.  
- **Human Factors:** Pressure to continue, fatigue, IMSAFE.

## 5️⃣ Student Prompts
### A. Preflight / Performance
1. Compute W&B and confirm CG limits for each leg.  
2. Estimate takeoff roll @ KVGT and KPSP given high temps.  
3. Choose safe cross-Banning Pass altitude and oxygen requirements.  
4. Build fuel plan including taxi + reserve ≥ 45 min.  

### B. Regulations
5. Explain 61.133 privileges; can this flight be for hire under Part 91?  
6. Define “holding out” and common carriage.  
7. PIC logging and compensation discussion.  

### C. Weather / ADM
8. Read KOKB TAF showing BKN010 by 1900Z — can you arrive legally VFR?  
9. Discuss mountain-wave and thermal activity departing Las Vegas.  
10. Choose alternates if Oceanside goes IFR early.  

### D. Systems
11. Gear motor runs after extension — diagnosis & manual procedure.  
12. Alternator failure — load shedding plan.  
13. Prop governor overspeed symptoms & actions.  

### E. Airspace / Nav
14. Route through Class B (LAS) & MOAs near Twentynine Palms.  
15. VFR flight following use and lost-comms actions.  
16. Emergency landing options over desert terrain.  

### F. Maneuvers
17. Power-off 180 key points and errors.  
18. Pivotal altitude formula for eights-on-pylons.  
19. Steep spiral setup and energy management.  

### G. Human Factors
20. Passengers press to “beat the fog.” Apply 5P decision model.  
21. IMSAFE check and stress management for heat and schedule.

## 6️⃣ What-If Curveballs
- KPSP crosswind > demonstrated value.  
- KOKB becomes IFR on descent — divert where?  
- Fuel delay @ KPSP forces re-calc of reserves.  
- Gear fails to retract after KPSP — drag impact & terrain clearance.  
- Extra 25 lb drone equipment added — CG shift analysis.  

---

## 7️⃣ Examiner Notes / Expected Responses
- Accurate POH performance and margin discussion.  
- W&B within limits; anticipates aft CG with fuel burn.  
- Understands common carriage restrictions.  
- Applies wave and coastal weather awareness.  
- Recalls gear manual extension steps.  
- Human-factor decision solid (“Safety > schedule”).
