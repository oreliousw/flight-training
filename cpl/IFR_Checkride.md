✅ Instrument ASEL Checkride – Examiner Checklist

(Cessna 172 – FAA-S-ACS-8B)

⸻

🧭 Preflight / Oral

[ ] Weather interpretation (METAR, TAF, Prog, Radar)
[ ] IFR flight planning & alternate requirements
[ ] Fuel calculations & reserves
[ ] Systems & avionics operation (NAV/GPS/Autopilot)
[ ] IFR currency & equipment requirements (91.171, 91.205)
[ ] Risk mgmt, ADM, lost comms (91.185)

⸻

🛫 Pre-Takeoff / Departure

[ ] ATIS / Clearance Copy
[ ] Verify flight plan loaded / altitudes correct
[ ] Brief departure procedure
[ ] Verify CDI/HSI source → GPS or VLOC
[ ] Instrument check (compass, gyro, turn coordinator)
[ ] Takeoff under the hood / simulate IMC

⸻

🚀 Basic Attitude / Instrument Flying

[ ] Straight & level ±100 ft, ±10° hdg, ±10 kts
[ ] Constant rate climbs/descents ±100 ft
[ ] Standard rate turns ±10° heading
[ ] Unusual attitude recovery (nose-high / nose-low)
[ ] Partial panel (simulate vacuum/electric failure)

⸻

🧮 Navigation & Holds

[ ] Intercept / track VOR/GPS courses ±5°
[ ] Holding entries (direct / parallel / teardrop)
[ ] Maintain altitude ±100 ft, timing ±5 sec
[ ] Identify fix passage & outbound timing
[ ] Correct for wind drift

⸻

🛬 Approaches

[ ] ILS or LPV precision approach (±½ scale localizer, ±¼ scale GS)
[ ] VOR / LOC / LNAV non-precision approach (±1 dot/needle)
[ ] Circling approach (within protected area)
[ ] Missed approach: climb, config, nav transition
[ ] Timed approach if GPS fails
[ ] Maintain situational awareness under workload

⸻

⚡ Emergencies / Abnormals

[ ] Lost comms (91.185 procedure)
[ ] Vacuum / AHRS / ADC / GPS failure
[ ] Alternate nav cross-check
[ ] Alternate missed approach execution

⸻

🧾 Post-Flight

[ ] Approach log & debrief
[ ] Examiner reviews ADM / workload mgmt
[ ] ACS standards applied per task
[ ] Notes: evaluate precision, awareness, decision-making

🧠 Notes for Examiner
	•	Assess instrument scan, procedural flow, workload mgmt
	•	Evaluate use of checklists and callouts
	•	Emphasize stabilized approaches & risk mgmt
	•	Yukkuri daijoubu – take it easy, precision comes with calm 🙂
